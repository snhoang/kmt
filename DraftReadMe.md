# Agile Methodology
## User Involvement in Design
On 2/21/18, DH Synergetech consultants interviewed users (firefighters) in person at the Butte County CalFire Emergency Command Center to identify a useful application for a Knowledge Management Tool (KMT) that would provide value to CalFire. The firefighters suggested a KMT that mimics the functionality of the “Magnet Board” used to model the firefighting resources available to the county for incident response.  Currently the magnet board is a physical board located in the Command Center.  The goal of the Magnet Board KMT would be to represent the information represented in this magnet board in electronic format, viewable from any location in a responsive format.  Underlying the Magnet Board is new functionality for a Knowledge Management Tool for the fire stations, engines, and other associated firefighting equipment.

Initial mockups based on the Magnet Board were developed and shared with development team in GitHub https://github.com/dhsynergetech/kmt/blob/master/CalFire%20Mockups%20v2.docx
## Sprint Planning
The DH Synergetech consultants began the scrum process on 2/22/18 with Sprint planning session to review draft user stories based on the interview with firefighters as well as requirements in the RFI.  User stories were developed, documented, and prioritized in the Kanban board in GitHub at https://github.com/dhsynergetech/kmt/projects/1
## Daily Scrum
The DH Synergetech consultants began daily 15 minute scrum calls on 2/23/18, with a plan to conduct two 1 (one) week sprints for the RFI.  Plan is to conduct sprint review's with firefighters to obtain feedback on the CalFire Magnet Board KMT tool. Daily collaboration for the team is enhanced via a Slack channel at https://dhsynergetech.slack.com/?redir=%2Fhome
