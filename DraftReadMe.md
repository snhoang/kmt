# Agile Methodology
## User Involvement in Design
On 2/21/18, DH Synergetech consultants interviewed users (firefighters) in person at the Butte County CalFire Emergency Command Center to identify a useful application for a Knowledge Management Tool (KMT) that would provide value to CalFire. The firefighters suggested a KMT that mimics the functionality of the “Magnet Board” used to model the firefighting resources available to the county for incident response.  Currently the magnet board is a physical board located in the Command Center.  The goal of the Magnet Board KMT would be to represent the information represented in this magnet board in electronic format, viewable from any location in a responsive format.  Underlying the Magnet Board is new functionality for a Knowledge Management Tool for the fire stations, engines, and other associated firefighting equipment.

Initial mockups based on the Magnet Board were developed and shared with development team in GitHub https://github.com/dhsynergetech/kmt/blob/master/CalFire%20Mockups%20v2.docx
## Sprint Planning
The DH Synergetech consultants began the scrum process on 2/22/18 with Sprint planning session to review draft user stories based on the interview with firefighters as well as requirements in the RFI.  User stories were developed, documented, and prioritized in the Kanban board in GitHub at https://github.com/dhsynergetech/kmt/projects/1
## Daily Scrum
The DH Synergetech consultants began daily 15 minute scrum calls on 2/23/18, with a plan to conduct two 1 (one) week sprints for the RFI.  Plan is to conduct sprint review's with firefighters to obtain feedback on the CalFire Magnet Board KMT tool. Daily collaboration for the team is enhanced via a Slack channel at https://dhsynergetech.slack.com/?redir=%2Fhome

## Digital Services Playbook Requirements
Requirement | DH Synergetech Approach
-------------------- | --------------------
a.	Assigned one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted | Assigned Brendon Delong as Delivery Manager responsible for the prototype.
b.	Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes, at a minimum, five (5) of the labor categories as identified in Attachment B: PQVP AD-DS Labor Category Description | Multi-Disciplinary Team: Delivery Manager (Brendon DeLong), Product Manager (Jacob Hayes), Agile Coach (Pamela Jarrett), Technical Architect (Sabu Azeez), Front End Developer (Steve Hoang), Full Stack Web Developer (Shabna Shurafadeen).
c.	Understood what people needed by including people in the prototype development and design process | Involved users: Design of KMT, User Stories, Sprint Reviews, User Testing, and an iterative development process.
d.	Used at least a minimum of three (3) user-centric design techniques and/or tools | Used story boards, prototype testing, and an iterative process to interact with the firefighters (users).
e.	Used GitHub to document code commits | DH Synergetech used the following GitHub repository: Dhsynergetech / kmt
f.	Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API | Run time RESTful APIs were published in Swagger 
g.	Complied with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0 | INSERT RESPONSE
h.	Created or used a design style guide and/or pattern library | Used jHipster framework with Reactive code.
i.	Performed usability tests with people | The Product Manager is a former firefighter who performed testing and facilitated user testing with the other firefighters.
j.	Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype | The DHSynergetech KMT was developed in two iterations (sprints) and reviewed by users during each sprint review.
k.	Created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design | INSERT RESPONSE
l.	Used at least five (5) modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.) | INSERT RESPONSE
m.	Deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used | INSERT RESPONSE
n.	Developed automated unit tests for their code | INSERT RESPONSE
o.	Setup or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider | INSERT RESPONSE
p.	Setup or used configuration management | INSERT RESPONSE
q.	Setup or used continuous monitoring | INSERT RESPONSE
r.	Deployed their software in an open source container, such as Docker (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization) | INSERT RESPONSE
s.	Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine; and | INSERT RESPONSE
t.	Prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge | INSERT RESPONSE
