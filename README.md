# Knowledge Management Tool
## Working Prototype Guidelines
### Knowledge Creation
The Working Prototype should:
- Have the ability to easily create “knowledge articles” (KAs).
- These can be original records (e.g., specific work instructions or content) and/or packages of content, including documents, user-configurable forms, tables, and workflows
- Have the ability to provide multiple levels and formats of information in KAs (e.g., bullet points for senior technical levels, scripted specific details for junior/non-technical staff)
- Allow for role-based security access, to allow control of access and level of information by login
### Knowledge Sharing
The Working Prototype should:
- Allow for the promotion of process and information across systems and channels, as required
- Have the ability to create user-defined rules for creation (e.g., mandatory fields) and lifecycle management (e.g., who, how, when revised and updated)
- Trigger escalation processes (e.g., automated emails/texts to approvers, reminders) for lifecycle activities
revised and updated)

### Knowledge Development
The Working Prototype should:
• Have the ability to update and improve KAs and access the value of usage as input to predicting new records or record types
• Show innovation by learning from existing records (e.g., types, content, usage) and prompting to create new KAs
